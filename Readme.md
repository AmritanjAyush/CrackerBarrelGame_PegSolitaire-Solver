## About the game 
This is a solver program for the Cracker Barrel game or Triangular Peg Solitaire.
Millions of people have  played this game, and at first it appears to be very easy. However, after a few moves, 
reality sets in, and the game no longer feels as simple.

**The rules of the game are simple and are described below:**

✓ The only action that can be performed in this game is to move a peg from its 
occupied position to a vacant spot two positions away.

✓ The only condition is that the position between the start and end point must be 
occupied, completing this move eliminates the peg that was in that position.

✓ The objective of the game is to remove as many pegs from the board as possible 
with the ideal goal of only having a single peg left.

Only about 400,000 of the more  than 7.3 million possible permutations yield successful results, which is a good 
representation of how challenging this game may well be. 

One wrong move, and you can watch the finish line steadily edging away from you, until you reach a dead-end. You 
see that there are more than one pegs left with no more valid moves to make, and with 
that you realize that you have probably been tricked and maybe winning this game is 
only a matter of chance and not strategy. (Trust me, I've been there)

There are still numerous tenacious people who dream of cracking the Cracker Barrel 
game, and through this project it is my aim to help them. This solver program will offer the user with the correct sequence of movements to find a solution, given 
the starting configuration of the board
