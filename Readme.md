## Instructions to use

**Solver.py** is the main file. It will solve it and generate *output.gif*.

Make sure to ```pip install requirements.txt```.

**for-if-you-want-to-test.ipynb** is a python nb version of this app. Very highly recommend experimenting there.

Apologies for lack of documentation. Whatsapp me if questions arise.
